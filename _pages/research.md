*Why House Price Beliefs Are Extrapolated Only in Booms* \
Summary: House price beliefs exhibit momentum during booms but not in downturns, converging to market prices from different ex-ante levels of optimism. This study suggests that sales data contain information about price trajectories in booms, as equity-constrained homeowners seek reservation gains, whereas in downturns, sales signal only current price levels not trajectories.

*House Price Discontinuities and the Labor-Leisure Trade-off*\
Summary: The labor-leisure trade-off model assumes consumers have access to identical choice sets. This clearly does not apply to housing, where availability varies dramatically both within and between countries, as well as across price segments. This study examines how panel households across a sample of OECD countries have encountered distinct house price discontinuities over time. Using bunching estimation techniques, I find that these price discontinuities significantly increase households' consumption of leisure. The results suggest that addressing housing market inefficiencies could help alleviate labor shortages in several European economies.
