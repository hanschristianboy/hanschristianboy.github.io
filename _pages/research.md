*Boom vs Bust in House Price Belief Formation* \
Summary: House price beliefs show momentum in booms but not in downturns. I argue that this is because market observers process price signals differently in booms than in downturns given homeowner incentives to climb the property ladder. 

*Predatory Trading in Housing Markets* \
Summary: I show how real estate investors exploited a funding shock to a subset of investors in 1930s Philadelphia to engage in predatory trading. This strategy was highly profitable but destroyed significant housing wealth in affected neighborhoods.
