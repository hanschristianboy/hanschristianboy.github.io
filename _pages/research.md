*Why House Price Beliefs Are Extrapolated Only in Booms* \
Summary: House price beliefs exhibit momentum during booms but not in downturns, converging to market prices from different ex-ante levels of optimism. This study suggests that sales data contain information about price trajectories in booms, as equity-constrained homeowners seek reservation gains, whereas in downturns, sales signal only current price levels not trajectories.

*Housing Shortages and the Labor-Leisure Trade-off*\
Summary: Why do some wealthy economies face skilled labor shortages despite their workers supplying relatively little labor? I examine this puzzle through the lens of housing service availability, which exhibits substantial variation both within and across countries and across price segments. Pooling household panels from several OECD countries, I demonstrate household encounters with distinct house price discontinuities over time. Using bunching estimation techniques, I find that these price discontinuities induce households to consume considerably more leisure. The results suggest that addressing housing market inefficiencies could help alleviate labor shortages in several European economies.
