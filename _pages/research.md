*Why House Price Beliefs Are Extrapolated Only in Booms* \
Summary: House price beliefs exhibit momentum during booms but not in downturns, converging to market prices from different ex-ante levels of optimism. This study suggests that sales data contain information about price trajectories in booms, as equity-constrained homeowners seek reservation gains, whereas in downturns, sales signal only current price levels not trajectories.

*Limited Housing Choice and the Labor-Leisure Trade-off*\
Summary: The labor-leisure trade-off assumes that all consumers face identical consumption sets. This is manifestly not the case as the availability of housing varies greatly within and across countries. This study shows that the ease with which households can move to another property is a key determinant of cross-country differences in labor supply: greater housing choice leads households to supply more labor.
