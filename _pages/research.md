*Boom vs Bust in House Price Belief Formation* \
Summary: House price beliefs show momentum in booms but not in downturns. I argue that this is because market observers process price signals differently in booms than in downturns given homeowner incentives to climb the property ladder. Ample evidence at the levels of dwellings and of neighborhoods supports this view.

*The Property Ladder and the Labor-Leisure Trade-off* \
Summary: A small increase of a household's labor supply can enable a discontinuous jump in their consumption of housing services as downpayment-constrained homeowners climb up the property ladder. Through a natural experiment in Depression-era Philadelphia, I show that marginal climbers increase their labor supply around the time of their intended home purchase.
