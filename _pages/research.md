*Why House Price Beliefs Are Extrapolated Only in Booms* \
Summary: House price beliefs exhibit momentum during booms but not in downturns, converging to market prices from different ex-ante levels of optimism. This study suggests that sales data contain information about price trajectories in booms, as equity-constrained homeowners seek reservation gains, whereas in downturns, sales signal only current price levels not trajectories.

*Housing Shortages and the Labor-Leisure Trade-off*\
Summary: Why do some high-income economies face skilled labor shortages despite their skilled workers supplying relatively little labor? I examine this puzzle through the lens of housing service availability, which varies substantially across countries, regions, and price segments. I detect household encounters with distinct house price discontinuities in panel data from several OECD countries. Bunching estimation reveals that these price discontinuities deter households from consuming more housing services, leading them to choose considerably more leisure instead. The findings suggest that better-functioning housing markets could help alleviate labor shortages in several European economies.
