*Boom vs Bust in House Price Belief Formation* \
Summary: House price beliefs show momentum in booms but not in downturns. I argue that this is because market observers process price signals differently in booms than in downturns given homeowner incentives to climb the property ladder. Ample evidence at the levels of dwellings and of neighborhoods supports this view.

*Housing Investors as Market Stabilizers* \
Summary: In the Great Depression, owner-occupiers and housing investors responded differently to a neighbor’s financial distress. While owner-occupiers were more likely to sell their homes in response to observing distress, investors were less likely to do so. I estimate investors’ impact on local house price gradients and show that they stabilized housing markets considerably.
